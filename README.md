## Inspiration
Whenever students want to meet up to study or chat, we often spend a substantial amount of time roaming buildings in search of an available room. With SpaceFinder, study groups can easily see all available study rooms that match their needs without the hassle of combing through every hallway for an empty space.

## What it does
SpaceFinder lets you see all the study rooms in a building along with their current occupancy, function, and privacy settings. You can check-in to a study area by scanning a QR code and edit your preferences for the room.

## How we built it
The front-end was built using PHP on CodeIgniter and Sass. The back-end was built with SQL.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into some challenges communicating our ideas to each other and delegating different tasks to each person. We also had some problems working with CSS to get the exact look that we wanted.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud that we all challenged ourselves and learned a lot during this hackathon. We are proud that we were able to discuss our different ideas for this application and collaborate to create a useful app for our fellow Comets.

## What we learned
We learned how to effectively plan a project and all of its different parts. We also learned how to better collaborate and share ideas. We learned a lot about PHP during this project.

## What's next for SpaceFinder
We look forward to integrating SpaceFinder with voice assistants and adding more features, such inviting friends to a study room, create tags for different classes, and scheduling regular events.
