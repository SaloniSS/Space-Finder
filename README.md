What It Does: SpaceFinder lets you see all the study rooms in a building along with their current occupancy, function, and privacy settings. You can check-in to a study room by scanning the qr-code and edit your preferences for the room.

How We Built It: The front-end was built using PHP on CodeIgniter and Sass. The back-end was built using SQL.
